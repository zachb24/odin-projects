    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Frying pan (Stainless steel, Cast iron, Carbon steel are preferable)</li>
        <li>Your choice of steak (I recommend Ribeye!)</li>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Dry brine the steak (1.5% weight of steak) for at least 1 hour, up to 24 hours in advance</li>
        <li>Pre-heat the frying pan for 5 minutes or so</li>
        <li>Add 1 or 1.5 Tbps olive oil, it should slightly smoke to let you know the temperature is ready for searing</li>
        <li>Add steak to pan and get a good sear on each side</li>
        <li>After searing, flip the steak every 15 seconds to ensure even cooking</li>
        <li>At this point, add your aromatics and butter</li>
        <li>Cook to your desired doneness, then let the steak rest for 5 minutes</li>
        <li>Enjoy!</li>
